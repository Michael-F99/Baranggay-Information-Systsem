# Branggay Information System
The Barangay Information System is a group project developed in collaboration with my classmates. This system is designed to help barangay officials manage resident records and administrative data in a more organized and efficient manner.

The project aims to digitalize common barangay processes by providing a centralized platform for storing, retrieving, and updating information. It helps reduce manual paperwork, improve data accuracy, and streamline daily barangay operations.

This project was created as part of our academic requirements and serves as a practical application of our skills in system development, teamwork, and problem-solving.
